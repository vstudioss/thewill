== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Questions You Might Ask Concerning Our Instagram Plugin InstaShow Lite

= How popup deep linking option works in the Pro version of InstaShow? =
You open any photo from your Instagram feed in popup. In case of turning on this feature, InstaShow will add a special hashtag to the existing URL of the page. Now by copying the derived URL, you will get the link to the chosen Instagram image. Therefore, anyone can click on it and see this image in popup straight away.

= How can I test InstaShow features before downloading the plugin? =
We've created a special web page with the Online Demo on it. Just follow this [link](http://elfsight.com/instagram-feed-instashow/wordpress/?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=wordpressorg&utm_content=description&utm_campaign=instashowlite) and play with all features of our Instagram feed.

= How many photos can I display in my Instagram feed? =
Moreover, in the pro version of the Instagram feed you are able to restrict the number of loaded Instagram photos using "limit" feature. In this case, Instagram feed will always show all Instagram pics from your username.

= What is the purpose of Instagram Access Token? =
For using Instagram plugins and displaying Instagram photos right on a website you have to operate with Instagram API. Access Token is exactly what you need for such operation.

Instagram Access Token is special key which allows only getting Instagram images and additional information about them from Instagram, such as likes counter, comments and author name. Instagram Access Token doesn't give ability to manage your Instagram profile or perform any actions in your name.

= How to use InstaShow shortcode? =
You can add shortcode of our Instagram plugin to any place of your website. There are 3 variants of using shortcode:

1. You can insert it into content of any web page or blog post. Just copy the shortcode of the Instagram plugin to the Editor page when you edit a page or a post.
2. You can insert the Instagram plugin shortcode into text widget. It might be useful if it’s required to add the Instagram feed to a sidebar. Note that your theme should include a special filter: `add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');` If your theme doesn’t include it then it’s necessary to add this filter to functions.php of the theme. After that drag and drop text widget into any sidebar and copy the shortcode into text widget.
3. You can insert the Instagram plugin shortcode into a template, footer or any other php file of your WordPress theme. To do this use the following function: `<?php echo do_shortcode('[instashow]'); ?>`. Learn more about this function on [https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_shortcode/](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_shortcode/)

= What if someone get my Instagram Access Token? =
The Instagram Access Token provides you with read only permissions. It means that you can only grab Instagram photos using the Instagram Access Token and nobody is able to manipulate your Instagram account.

= How to increase the speed of Instagram image loading? =
The loading time depends on the number of Instagram images in the Instagram grid. You can display less Instagram images to speed up the loading.

Also you can use cache_media_time option to cache the Instagram images in browser’s local storage. So images in your Instagram feed won’t be uploaded each time someone refresh the web page and they will stay in browser’s storage for as long as you wish. Also, please, note that during the chosen period your Instagram feed won’t load new Instagram images.

= Showcase =
InstaShow has a great number of customizable features. That’s why, there are lots of possibilities of how your Instagram feed can be displayed on a website. We’ve prepared some good ideas which will help you to get the biggest benefit of using our plugin. However, remember that you can create any Instagram gallery using your imagination.

* Default settings (2 rows and 3 grids) – here is the composition which we use in our [Online Demo](http://elfsight.com/instagram-feed-instashow/wordpress/?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=wordpressorg&utm_content=description&utm_campaign=instashowlite). In case of using our Instagram feed InstaShow as one of major elements on a web page this settings will be a perfect decoration.
* One-row photo Instagram gallery – perfect for driving attraction to the Instagram feed by setting this grid in the center of your content. Use several columns in order to adjust its size to your website’s requirements. You can also implement autorotation mode for more entertaining effect.
* One-column photo Instagram gallery – good case if you want to display your Instagram photos from one side of your web content. Instagram plugin will be a good addition for any of your thoughts. For this case, we recommend to use vertical Instagram photo scrolling.
* Large grid with smaller Instagram photos – show more of your Instagram feed at once. Create a big Instagram grid, make it responsive and be sure that you have enough Instagram photos in your profile.
* Single Instagram photo grid – don’t want to spend a lot of your website’s space on Instagram? Here is the solution. Show one Instagram photo per page in the grid so that your web audience will be able to enjoy your amazing Instagram images.
* Custom source with “only” filter – let’s assume that you want to display some Instagram account (for example, national geographic profile) but show only specific Instagram images (for example, Instagram images marked with “nature” hashtag). You can create your custom Instagram grid with such parameters. Just define your main Instagram username in the source field and enter the desired Instagram hashtag or multiple hashtags in the “only” filter.
* Custom source with “except” filter – what if you want to exclude some Instagram photos from your feed? You can do this using “except” filter. Firstly, choose all needed Instagram sources and then set any Instagram username, hashtag or photo URL in the filter’s field. As a result, your Instagram feed will be free of undesired content.
